## Introduction

Before you can work with CircleCI and Partner-certified orbs, you must first ensure that your platform version is set to `2.1` in your `config.yml`. Previous versions do not currently support working with orbs.

The section below describes how you can set your platform version to 2.1 so you can work with orbs.

## Setting Your Platform to Work With Orbs

Setting your platform version to work with orbs is a very simple process, requiring you to perform the following steps:

1) Use CircleCI version 2.1 at the top of your `.circleci/config.yml` file.

`version: 2.1`

**NOTE:** {% include snippets/enable-pipelines.md %}

2) Add the `orbs` stanza below your version, thereby invoking the orb. The example below shows how you can invoke the `aws-cli` orb.

```
orbs:
  aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@0.1.13
```

3) Use the elements specific to your selected orb in your existing workflows and jobs.

### Hello World Example

The example below demonstrates how you can invoke the `hello-build` orb in the `circleci` namespace.

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  hello: circleci/hello-build@0.0.5

workflows:
  "Hello Workflow":
    jobs:
      - hello/hello-build
```
