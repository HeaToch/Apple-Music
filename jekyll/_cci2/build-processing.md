This document describes how to enable the pipelines engine if you need to trigger workflows from the CircleCI API or auto-cancel workflows. Pipelines are not currently available on self hosted installations of CircleCI Server.

## What are Pipelines?

CircleCI Pipelines encompass the full set of workflows you run when triggering work on your projects in CircleCI. Workflows coordinate the jobs defined within your project configuration.

## Benefits of Using Pipelines

### Pipelines with 2.0 Configuration
{:.no_toc}

When using 2.0 configuration in combination with pipelines, CircleCI will inject the `CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL` environment variable into all jobs for backwards compatibility. This environment variable is generated in a different way to the version that is available in legacy jobs, and is not always available â€“ it is not injected when there is no meaningful previous revision, for example, on the first push of commits to an empty repository, or when a new branch is created/pushed without any additional commits.
